The solution avoids directly using `min-width` and `max-width` with `calc()`. Instead, it employs media queries to set appropriate width ranges based on the viewport's size:

```css
.sidebar {
  width: 20%;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
  .sidebar {
    width: 200px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 2000px) {
  .sidebar {
    width: 400px;
  }
}
```

This approach ensures that the sidebar's width will never exceed 400px, and will be at least 200px, while maintaining the intended 20% width for most cases.  Itâ€™s also more reliable and cross-browser compatible than relying solely on `calc()` for both width calculation and constraint enforcement.

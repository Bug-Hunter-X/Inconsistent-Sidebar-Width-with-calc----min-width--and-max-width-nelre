The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error: unexpected behavior when using `calc()` with percentages and multiple units.  The intention is to create a sidebar that takes up 20% of the viewport width, with a minimum width of 200px and a maximum width of 400px. However, using `min-width` and `max-width` directly with `calc()` often produces unexpected results in different browsers.

```css
.sidebar {
  width: calc(20% + 200px);
  min-width: 200px;
  max-width: 400px;
}
```

The issue is that the `min-width` and `max-width` declarations might not be correctly applied,  leading to the width exceeding 400px or falling below 200px depending on the viewport width and browser's interpretation of the CSS.
